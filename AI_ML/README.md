# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

According to Columbia University, "artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data." [source](https://ai.engineering.columbia.edu/ai-vs-machine-learning/). 

## Why should you learn Machine Learning as a student?

Machine learning helps you automate tasks, which would usually be time consuming and difficult if done manually. You may have seen how you receive recommendations on the Amazon shopping app about what to buy based on your previous purchases. Machine learning achieves this feat by analyzing lots of data to learn obvious patterns on how one product is related to another. For example, you can use machine learning to train a chatbot that can answer queries about a specific product when a user has doubts before purchasing it.
