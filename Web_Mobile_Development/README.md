# Web and Mobile Development

## What is web development?

According to the Chrome DevRel team, web development refers to the ability to build "beautiful, accessible, fast, and secure websites that work cross-browser, and for all of your users." [source](https://web.dev/about/).

## What is mobile development?

"Mobile application development is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources. Hence, the mobile development process involves creating installable software bundles (code, binaries, assets, etc.), implementing backend services such as data access with an API, and testing the application on target devices." [source](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/mobile-application-development/)

## Why should you learn web and mobile development as a student?

You want to create an online store to showcase and sell a certain product or service. The online store will be accessed primarily through websites or mobile phones to increase the reach of your offering. The required skills for building this online store include front-end development to create an interactive interface for your customers and back-end development to manage the application's data. To make the application scalable, reliable, and available, you will need to deploy it on a cloud platform.

You can learn more about web development by visiting [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
