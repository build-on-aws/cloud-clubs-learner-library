# Serverless

## What is Severless?

"Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. A cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure. Developers can simply package their code in containers for deployment." - [source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless)

## Why should you learn about Serverless as a student?

You are building an application for yourself and your peers to manage your coursework and study progress. Building it in a serverless environment is the easiest and fastest way to create this application. You can build an API to manage schedules and attendance with endpoints that your front-end application can call to trigger functions in the cloud. 

You can learn more about serverless by visiting [Serverless on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/)
